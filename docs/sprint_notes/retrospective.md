# Sprint dates: 1st two weeks of spring semester 2021

- What went well:
    - Planned how we're going to split up the api and front end into charity/globaladmin
    - Rough start with beginning of semester...but we started!

- What could be improved (how can we increase quality and effectiveness)?:
    - Make sure we start of with a planning meeting; hold regular backlog grooming sessions; 
    - After scrum of scrums we should have team meetings sooner, maybe even the same day to make sure iniformation is getting out to team members as quickly as possible.
    - Establish goals as early as possible.
    - Better communication outside of / inbetween team meetings
    - Better communication between teams
